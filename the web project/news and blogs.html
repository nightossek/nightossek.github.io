        <p>The stage is set for the ID.7! At the CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas between 5 and 8 January 2023, Volkswagen Group of America will showcase its first fully electric sedan based on the modular electric drive matrix (MEB). It will be clad in smart camouflage, which uses unique technology and multi-layered paintwork to create light effects on parts of the vehicle. This is an interactive feature and symbolizes the next step in the digitalization of the future flagship model of the ID. family. The ID. AERO concept vehicle initially presented in China already provided a preview of the new model</p>

        Freelance car journalist Gareth Herincx test drove the Jeep Renegade 4xe for HELLO! magazine recently – and after putting it through its paces across several different terrains, he seemed thoroughly impressed by the experience!
        Describing the ‘charismatic crossover’ as ‘an even more tempting proposition’ now that it’s available as an electrified version, he praised the 4xe for both its low running costs and low CO2 emissions – made possible by the vehicles hybrid technology and features such as regenerative braking – but noted that ‘despite the addition of hybrid technology, the Renegade remains much the same, which is no bad thing’.

    <p>The recently unveiled second-generation GLC will use electrification for all of its powertrains, ranging from 48-volt mild-hybrids to three different plug-in hybrids with an all-electric range of up to 62 miles. A fully-electric variant isn’t in the offing however, with the similarly-sized EQC occupying that space. It’s almost certain the GLC Coupe will be offered with the same range of powertrains as the GLC. 

      A GLC Coupe 200 4Matic will probably kick off the range with a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 48-volt assistance, developing 201bhp and 320Nm of torque. There should also be an option of the same engine with 254bhp and 400Nm of torque. Alongside them is a mild-hybrid diesel 220 d 4MATIC with 194bhp and 440Nm of torque. 
      
      The plug-in hybrid tech featured in the new GLC should carry over to the Coupe model. Mercedes has two petrol-powered plug-in hybrids and a diesel option. They all use a 31kWh battery coupled to an electric motor with 134bhp and 440Nm of torque. An all-electric range of over 62 miles is claimed. </p>

    <p>Porsche's rally-inspired 911 Dakar, an off-road-prepped sports car, is a rolling nostalgia bin. Way back when, the 911 was a force in rallying, its rear-engine layout giving it traction in the dirt and muck, while that same rear-engine layout helped, er, whip the tail around rally-style. But Porsche never transferred that rally heritage directly into its roadgoing sports cars, leaving adventurous owners to lift their suspensions, fit burlier tires, and festoon their rides with fun running lights and roof racks and such—leading to the so-called "Safari-style" 911.</p>

    <p>Locally, the G20 was launched by BMW Malaysia in March 2019, first as a CBU 330i before the CKD version appeared half a year later. The much awaited entry-level variant, the 320i, surfaced in January 2020. Later that year, the 330e plug-in hybrid and the M340i xDrive joined the local range.

      For the G20 LCI, BMW Malaysia is kicking off with three variants, the 320i, 330i and 330e, all exclusively available in M Sport trim. No Sport, and God forbid Luxury, because all Malaysians want is ///M. By the way, the pre-facelift 320i was launched as a Sport, before a Runout Edition added on M Sport trim. </p>

    <p>Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini, remarked: “Our trend of growth and development continues, and this shows that our direction is sound and our choices are on the mark. This is the product of well-defined collective assessments and strategies that can produce consistent and concrete results. 2023 is going to be a year of challenges and changes that we are ready to confront by always pushing ourselves beyond. We now have the opportunity to focus on our next objectives also thanks to an 18-month waiting list.</p>
